  death deals a heavy hand.
  their cup of sorrow full.
  we await the Prince of Peace.
  in far too many lands;
  poverty aplenty,
  hearts gone wild with war.
  The dreams of men are empty,
    4. The clouds shall send a Saviour like softly falling rain,
    yet mighty is his power,
    His shield will be compassion,
    to free us from our chains.
    his weapon liberty.`
